Appendix: Open Source Software
==================================

Many of the implementation details presented in this book were
informed by Aether, an open source 5G edge cloud connectivity
service. This appendix serves as a guide for gaining hands-on
experience with that software. To track the latest updates to the
software (and its documentation), we recommend starting here:
