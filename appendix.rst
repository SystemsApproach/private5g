Appendix: Open Source Software
==================================

Many of the implementation details presented in this book were
informed by Aether, an open source 5G edge cloud connectivity
service. This appendix serves as a guide for gaining hands-on
experience with that software. An on-line version of this appendix,
tracking the latest changes to the software, is available at:
