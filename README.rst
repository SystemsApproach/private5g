Build the Book
--------------

To build a web-viewable version, you first need to download the source:

.. code:: shell 

   $ mkdir ~/5G 
   $ cd ~/5G 
   $ git clone https://github.com/SystemsApproach/5G.git 

The build process is stored in the Makefile and requires Python be 
installed. The Makefile will create a virtualenv (``doc_venv``) which 
installs the documentation generation toolset. 

To generate HTML in ``_build/html``,  run ``make html``.

To check the formatting of the book, run ``make lint``.

To see the other available output formats, run ``make``.
