Source Directory
--------------------------

Source code for Aether and all of its subsystems is distributed across
multiple repositories:

* Gerrit repository for the CORD Project
  (https://gerrit.opencord.org): Microservices for AMP, plus source
  for the jobs that implement the CI/CD pipeline.

* GitHub repository for the OMEC Project
  (https://github.com/omec-project): Microservices for SD-Core, plus
  the emulator that subjects SD-Core to RAN workloads.

* GitHub repository for the ONOS Project
  (https://github.com/onosproject): Microservices for SD-Fabric and
  SD-RAN, plus the YANG models used to generate the Aether API.

* GitHub repository for the Stratum Project
  (https://github.com/stratum): On-switch components of SD-Fabric.
  
For Gerrit, you can either browse Gerrit (select the `master` branch)
or clone the corresponding *<repo-name>* by typing:

.. code-block::

   $ git clone ssh://gerrit.opencord.org:29418/<repo-name>

Deployment artifacts are pulled from the following repositories:

Helm Charts

The Aether CI/CD pipeline, which keeps the above artifact repos in
sync with the source repos, can be found here:

 | ROC: https://gerrit.opencord.org/plugins/gitiles/roc-helm-charts
 | SD-RAN: https://github.com/onosproject/sdran-helm-charts
 | SD-Core: https://gerrit.opencord.org/plugins/gitiles/sdcore-helm-charts
 | SD-Fabric (Servers): https://github.com/onosproject/onos-helm-charts  
 | SD-Fabric (Switches): https://github.com/stratum/stratum-helm-charts

The Jenkins Jobs that implement the CI/CD pipeline are checked into:

 | https://gerrit.opencord.org/plugins/gitiles/aether-ci-management 

These jobs, in turn, depend on QA tests that are checked into:

 | https://gerrit.opencord.org/plugins/gitiles/aether-system-tests 

For more information about Aether's CI/CD pipeline, including its QA
and version control strategies, we recommend the Lifecycle Management
chapter of our companion Edge Cloud Operations book.
