Networking Foundation (ONF) engineering team. While at ONF, he was
Vice President for Research & Development, where led all
mobile-related projects.  Before joining ONF, Sunay was the CTO at
Argela-USA, where he was the innovator of a Programmable Radio Access
Network Architecture (ProgRAN) for 5G that enabled the world’s first
dynamically programmable RAN slicing solution. He has also held prior
industry positions at Nokia Research Center and Bell Laboratories,
where he focused on 3G and 4G end-to-end systems architectures and
participated and chaired various standardization activities. Sunay has
also spent over 10 years in academia, as a Professor of Electrical and
Computer Engineering. He holds many U.S. and European patents on
