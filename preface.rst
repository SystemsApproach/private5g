Preface 
=======

When we wrote our introductory 5G book two years ago, our goal was to
help people with experience building Internet and Cloud services
understand the opportunity to bring best practices from those systems
to the mobile cellular network. On paper (and in the press) 5G had set
an ambitious goal of transformative changes, adopting a cloud-inspired
architecture and supporting a new set of innovative services. But the
gap between that aspirational story and the reality of 40 years of
network operators and hardware vendors protecting their incumbent
advantages made for a challenging pivot. So we started with the
basics, and set out to explain the fundamental networking concepts and
design principles behind the myriad of acronyms that dominate mobile
cellular networking.

But Internet-time moves rapidly, once you start down that path.
Several cloud providers are starting to offer private 5G solutions for
enterprises, and there is a complete open source implementation of a
5G-enabled edge cloud that the Internet community can learn from and
build upon. The flood gates have opened, and this book is written to
help navigate it.
